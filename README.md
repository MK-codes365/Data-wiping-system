## Running the project

To run this project, you need to have Node.js and npm installed.

1.  **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Run the development server:**

    The app has two parts: the Next.js frontend and the Genkit AI backend. You'll need to run both for all features to work.

    In one terminal, run the Next.js dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

    In another terminal, run the Genkit dev server:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:watch
    ```

    The application will be available at http://localhost:9002.
